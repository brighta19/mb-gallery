## Setup Local Dev Environment

Open terminal or shell. Once you're in the main project folder, `cd` to this directory
```
cd client
```
Get the `.env` for environment variables and `mb-gallery.json` file for Python script from one of the active devs. The environment variables should have most of the configuration you need for Firebase.

Then run the following commands to start the server:
```
npm install
npm start
```
